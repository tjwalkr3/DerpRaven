HOW TO START MAUI APP:
1. Download the android emulator for api 34. 35 and later will not work. The api breaks the code.
2. Set the solution configuration drop down at the top of the screen to release instead of debug
3. Configure startup profile to include the maui app with the targeting device being the android emulator
4. Right click on solution and click configuration manager
5. Check deploy checkbox on the maui project
6. Start up and pray to the gods that it works
